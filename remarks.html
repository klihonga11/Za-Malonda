        <p>Thank you for checking out this course. I hope that it has been somewhat helpful to you. This 
            course does not cover everything but is simply the basics of Accounting. If you have enjoyed 
            this course then I recommend you find an Accounting text book and learn more. 
        </p>    
        <p>I am a software developer and not an accountant. I made this course because I believe that every 
            entrepreneur should know the basics of how to manage their finances. If there are any mistakes 
            in the course or you have any comments or if you need any software development help, feel free 
            to email me at klihonga11@gmail.com.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks again.</p>
