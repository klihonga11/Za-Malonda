        <h1>1.1 Introduction</h1>
        <p>Accounting is the recording and communicating of <strong>financial transactions</strong> of a business for both 
            the people running the business itself (internal users) and those outside the 
            business (external users).</p>
        <p>A financial transaction is an event that involves the business where money is exchanged. 
            A business paying salaries to its employees is a financial transaction but a business reaching 
            a hundred likes on their Facebook page is not.</p>
        <p>Internal users, like managers, can use this accounting information to make business decisions. 
            For example, calculating how much to charge for a product.</p>
        <p>External users, like banks or investors, can use this information to decide if it is worth 
            working with the business. For example, an investor needs to know if a business is going to 
            become profitable before investing.</p>
        <p>Overall, the reason accounting is important is that it tells you how well your business is doing.</p>
