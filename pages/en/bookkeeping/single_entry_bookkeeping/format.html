        <p>Date: the date on which the transaction took place.</p>
        <p>Description: a short explanation of the transaction. From the example, the first entry of the 
            month is named “Bal b/f” which is short for <strong>Balance Brought Forward</strong>. 
            This is the last balance amount from the previous month. 
            If you are starting a new business, there is no previous balance and so the Balance Brought 
            Forward is 0.
        </p>
        <p>Ref: This is short for reference. It is anything that can be used to track the transaction such 
            as a receipt number. If there is no reference, then it can be left blank.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Money In: the amount of money that has come into the business from the transaction.</p>
        <p>Mount Out: the amount of money that has gone out of the business from the transaction.</p>
        <p>Balance: calculated by taking the previous balance plus the money coming in minus the money going out. Each 
            transaction can only have one amount, either the money is coming into the business or the 
            money is going out of the business. <u>It cannot be both.</u>
