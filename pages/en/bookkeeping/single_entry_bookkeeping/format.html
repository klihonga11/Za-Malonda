        <p><b>Date</b>: the date on which the transaction took place.</p>
        <p><b>Description</b>: a short explanation of the transaction. 
            <ul>
                <li>The first entry of the month is named “Bal b/f” which is short for <strong>Balance Brought Forward</strong>.</li>
                <li>This is the last balance amount from the previous month.</li>
                <li>If you are starting a new business, there is no previous balance and so the Balance Brought Forward is 0.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><b>Ref</b>: short for reference. 
            <ul>
                <li>It is anything that can be used to track the transaction such as a receipt number.</li>
                <li>If there is no reference, then it can be left blank.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><b>Money In</b>: the amount of money that has come into the business from the transaction.</p>
        <p><b>Mount Out</b>: the amount of money that has gone out of the business from the transaction.</p>
        <p><b>Balance</b>: calculated by taking the previous balance plus the money coming in minus the money going out. 
            <ul>
                <li>Each transaction can only have one amount, either the money is coming into the business or the 
                    money is going out of the business. <u>It cannot be both.</u></li>
            </ul>
