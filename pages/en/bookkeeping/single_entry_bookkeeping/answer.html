        <p><b>Capital:</b> the amount of money used to start a business.</p>
        <p><b>Purchases:</b> the amount of money you spend on products to sell to your customers. Thomas bought 
            sugarcane to sell to his customers and so these are purchases.</p>
        <p><b>Expense:</b> the amount of money you spend to keep the business running. Thomas paid money for 
            transport to buy the sugarcane. He will not sell the transport, but without it, the business 
            cannot operate. Therefore, the transport is an expense to the business.</p>
        <p><b>Sales:</b> the amount of money you receive from selling products to your customers.</p>
