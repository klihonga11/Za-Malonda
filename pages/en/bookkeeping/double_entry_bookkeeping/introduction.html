        <h1>2.3.1 Introduction</h1>
        <p><b>Double entry bookkeeping</b> is the recommended and most widely used form of bookkeeping.</p>
        <p>It is the most widely used because it has many advantages over single entry bookeeping such as automatic error checking.</p>
        <p>When recording a transaction, at least <u>two entries</u> are made for <u>each</u> transaction – a <b>debit</b> in one <b>account</b> and a <b>credit</b> in another.</p>
        <p>An account is where you record the increases and decreases in money for a single item.</p>
        <p>For example, Thomas paying for transport will be recorded in a ‘transport’ account. Any other 
            time Thomas uses money for transport, it will also be recorded in this account.</p>
        <p>A debit is an entry into an account that is recorded on the <u>left</u> side of the account.</p>
        <p>A credit is an entry into an account that is recorded on the <u>right</u> side of the account.</p>

        <br />

        <p><em>Note</em>: Don't worry about <u>why</u> a debit is on the left and a credit is on the right. 
            There is no secret meaning behind it. It has just always been done that way. You just need to 
            memorize it.</p>
