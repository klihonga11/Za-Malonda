        <h1>2.3.3 Managing Accounts</h1>
        <p>The first three types of accounts (Drawings, Expenses and Assets) are to be <u>debited</u> when their 
            amounts <u>increase</u>, and <u>credited</u> when their amounts <u>decrease</u>.
        <p>The last three accounts (Liabilities, Equity, Revenue) are to be <u>credited</u> when their amounts 
            <u>increase</u>, and <u>debited</u> when their amounts <u>decrease</u>.</p>
        <p>One way to remember this is to memorize it as “DC DEALER”. </p>
        <p>DC stands for Debit-Credit. Debit on the left and credit on the right.</p>
        <p>For the first three letters on the left, DEA (Drawings, Expenses, Assets), to increase the account, you must 
            debit which is an entry on the left side of the account.
        </p> 
        <p>For the last three letters on the right, LER (Liabilities, Equity, Revenue), to increase the account, you must 
            credit which is an entry on the right side of the account.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p><em>Note</em>: Don't worry about why an increase or decrease is a certain type of account will 
            mean a debit or a credit. There is no secret meaning behind it. It has just always been done 
            that way. You just need to memorize it. </p>
