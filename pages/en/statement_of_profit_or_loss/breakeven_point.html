        <h1>6.7 Breakeven Point</h1>

        <p>When you start your business, you will be operating at a loss. You will have spent money on 
            your inventory without making any sales.
        </p>
        <p>As you start to make sales, you will begin getting closer to making a profit. But, you might still 
            make a loss because the number of products that you sold did not bring in enough money to pay 
            for your expenses.
        </p>
        <p>The <b>breakeven point</b> is the <u>number</u> of products you need to sell to neither make a profit 
            or a loss.
        </p>
        <p>It is the point where revenue income equals revenue expenditure and the net profit equals 0.</p>
        <p>Selling one more product at this point will result in making a profit while selling one less 
            product will result in a loss.</p>
        <p><mark>Breakeven point = revenue expenses / (selling price â€“ cost price)</mark></p>
        <p>Thomas bought sugarcane at K 100 and sells it at K 150. He needed to pay K 500 in transport to 
            buy the sugarcane. What is his breakeven point?</p>
        <p>Thomas needs to sell ten sugarcane in order to breakeven. </p>
        <p>If he sells nine sugarcane, he will make K 450 in sales. His expenses will be K 500. 
            Therefore, he will make a loss of K 50.
        </p>
        <p>If he sells eleven sugarcane, he will make K 550 in sales. His expenses will be K 500. 
            Therefore, he will make a profit of K 50.
        </p>
        <p>The breakeven point is very important because it gives you a sales target to aim for in order 
            to start being profitable.
