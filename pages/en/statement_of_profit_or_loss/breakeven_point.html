        <h1>6.7 Breakeven Point</h1>

        <p>When a new business starts, it begins operating at a loss. It will have spent money on 
            inventory without making any sales.
        </p>
        <p>As the business starts to make sales, it will begin getting closer to making a profit. But, it might still 
            make a loss because the number of products that it sold did not bring in enough money to pay 
            for its expenses.
        </p>
        <p>The <b>breakeven point</b> is the <i>number</i> of products a business needs to sell to neither 
            make a profit or a loss.
        </p>
        <p>It is the point where revenue income equals revenue expenditure and the net profit equals 0.</p>
        <p>Selling one <i>more</i> product at this point will result in making a profit while selling one <i>less</i> 
            product will result in a loss.</p>
        <p><mark>Breakeven point = revenue expenses / (selling price â€“ cost price)</mark></p>
        <p>Thomas bought sugarcane at K 100 and sells it at K 150. He needed to pay K 500 in transport to 
            buy the sugarcane. What is his breakeven point?</p>
        <p>Thomas needs to sell 10 sugarcane in order to breakeven. </p>
        <p>If he sells 9 sugarcane, he will make K 450 in sales. His expenses will be K 500. 
            Therefore, he will make a loss of K 50.
        </p>
        <p>If he sells 11 sugarcane, he will make K 550 in sales. His expenses will be K 500. 
            Therefore, he will make a profit of K 50.
        </p>
        <p>The breakeven point is very important because it gives the business a sales target to aim for 
            in order to start being profitable.
