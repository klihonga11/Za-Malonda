            <h1>6.6 Margin</h1>

            <p><b>Margin</b> (also known as profit margin) is the money the business <i>keeps</i> from selling a product.</p>
            <p><mark>Margin = selling price – cost price</mark></p>
            <p>You will notice that this formula is the same as when calculating a markup. However, the difference
                is shown when calculating margin as a percentage.
            </p>
            <p><mark>Margin = (selling price – cost price) / selling price * 100</mark></p>
            <p>Thomas buys one sugarcane at K 100 and sells it at K 150. Using the formula, Thomas’s margin for 
                sugarcane is K 50 which is a margin percentage of 33.3%.</p>
            <p>This means that for each sugarcane sold at K 150, Thomas keeps 33.3% (K 50) of the sale as 
                profit while the remaining 66.7% (K 100) is what was spent on purchasing the sugarcane.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p>What would the margin on sugarcane be if Thomas bought the sugarcane at K 100 but sold it at 
                K 250? The margin would be 60%. This means that for each sugarcane sold at K 250, Thomas keeps 
                60% (K 150) of the sale as profit while the remaining 40% (K 100) is what was spent on 
                purchasing the sugarcane.
            </p>
            <p>What would the margin on sugarcane be if Thomas bought the sugarcane at K 75 and sold it at 
                K 150? The margin would be 50%. This means that for each sugarcane sold at K 150, Thomas keeps 
                50% (K 75) of the sale as profit while the remaining 50% (K 75) is what was spent on 
                purchasing the sugarcane.
            </p>
            <p>This shows that in order to increase your margin, you must either: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Sell your products at a <i>higher</i> price or</li>
                    <li>Purchase your products at a <i>lower</i> price</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <br />
            <p>The goal of every business is to sell its products at the highest margin possible because having
                high margins increases the chances of reaching profitability <i>faster</i>.
            </p>
            <p>A high margin means that the business will have a higher gross profit, which 
                means it has more money to pay its expenses and will therefore make a higher net profit at the 
                end of its fiscal period.</p>
            <p>Therefore, it is easier to get people to invest in your business if the business shows that it 
                can sell its products at high margins.
            </p>
            <p>Businesses and the industries they operate in are different, but a high margin can be considered 
                to be above 50%.</p>

            <br />
            <p>Markup will <i>always</i> be higher than margin. As you've seen, Thomas's markup on sugarcane 
                is 50% while the margin is 33.3%.</p>
            <p>When deciding on the prices of your products, it is more important to look at the margin and 
                <i>not</i> the markup. This is because the markup is just how much more you are selling a product 
                while the margin is how much you <i>keep</i> as profit from selling a product. Therefore, 
                focusing on the markup can mislead you into thinking you are making more money than you actually are.
            </p>
            <p>If you want to sell a product at a specific margin, the following formula will calculate the 
                selling price at that margin:</p>
            <p><mark>Selling price = cost price / (1 – margin percentage)</mark></p>
            <p>If Thomas buys the sugarcane at K 100 but wants to make a 75% margin, using the formula provided,
                he will need to sell each sugarcane at K 400. The markup at this selling price is 300%.
