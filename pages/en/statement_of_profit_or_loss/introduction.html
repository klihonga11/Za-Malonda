        <h1>6.1 Introduction</h1>
        <p>The <b>statement of profit or loss</b> (also known as an income statement) is a <b>financial statement</b> that shows whether the business 
            has made a profit or a loss at the <i>end</i> of a fiscal period.</p>
        <p>A financial statement is a report that is made to show how well the business is doing.</p>
        <p>The numbers used in a statement of profit or loss are taken from the trial balance.</p>
        <p>There are two types of income:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Capital income</b>: money invested by the owner of the business. For example, the money Thomas used to start the business.</li>
                <li><b>Revenue income</b>: money made by the business from sales. The money Thomas receives from selling sugarcane.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>There are two types of expenses:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Capital expenditure</b>: money spent on items, which the business will benefit for more than one fiscal period. For example, the bucket Thomas will use to store sugarcane.</li>
                <li><b>Revenue expenditure</b>: money spent on day-to-day expenses. For example, the transport money used to buy sugarcane.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The profit or loss is calcluated by taking the <u>revenue income</u> minus the 
            <u>revenue expenditure</u>.</p>
