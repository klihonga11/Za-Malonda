        <h1>6.5 Markup</h1>

        <p><b>Markup</b> is the amount added on top of the cost price to reach the selling price of a product.</p>
        <p><mark>Markup = (selling price â€“ cost price) / cost price * 100</mark></p>
        <p>Thomas buys one sugarcane at K 100 and sells it at K 150. From the calculation, the markup on 
            the sugarcane is 50% (K 50). This means that the sugarcane was sold for 
            50% more than what Thomas paid for it.
        </p>
        <p>If Thomas buys one sugarcane at K 100 but sells it at K 200, the markup on the sugarcane is 100% (K 100).
            This means that the sugarcane was sold for 100% more than what Thomas paid for it.
