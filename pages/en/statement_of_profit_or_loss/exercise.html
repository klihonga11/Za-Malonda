        <p></p>The image above shows Thomas's trial balance at the end of the year.
        <p>After running his business for six months, Thomas was able to get a loan of K 50,000 from friends 
        and family to continue growing his business.</p>
        <p>As a result, he was able to buy a bicycle for K 15,000 to be used instead of paying money for 
            transport.</p>
        <p>He took K 5,000 out of the business to pay for his sonâ€™s school fees. </p>
        <p>With the loan, he was able to buy more goods for resale and needed a place to sell them. </p>
        <p>As a result, he rented a store and hired an employee to help him. </p>
        <p>He has also starting buying and selling products on credit. Products bought on credit are 
            belong to the <b>Accounts Payable</b> account, while sales made on credit belong to the 
            <b>Accounts Receivable</b> account.
        </p>
        <p>Later in the year, his bicycle broke down and he needed to pay for repairs.</p>
        <p>Inventory left unsold at the end of the year amounted to K 20,000.</p>

        <br />
        <p>Using the trial balance as at 31 December 2020, prepare Thomas's statement of profit or loss.</p>
