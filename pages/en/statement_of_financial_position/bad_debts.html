        <h1>7.8 Bad Debts</h1>
        
        <p>A <b>bad debt</b> happens when a customer who owes money to the business for products they 
            bought on credit becomes unable to pay the amount owed.</p>
        <p>At that time, it should no longer be included in the <u>account receivables</u> figure as it is no 
            longer an asset.</p>
        <p>A debt should <i>not</i> be written off as a bad debt until the business is sure that they will <i>never</i> 
            get the money back.</p>
        <p>In order to account for a bad debt, it is necessary to:
            <ul>
                <li>Show the total bad debts written off in the fiscal period as an expense in the 
                    statement of profit or loss.</li>
                <li>Subtract the amount of the bad debt from the accounts receivables figure in the 
                    statement of financial position.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
