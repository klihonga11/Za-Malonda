        <p> An <b>asset</b> an item the business owns that will make the business money in future.</p>
        <p><b>Non-current assets</b> (also known as fixed assets) are assets that will be used for more 
            than one fiscal period. For example, the bicycle Thomas bought.
        </p>
        <p><b>Current assets</b> are assets that will be used within the fiscal period. For example, 
            inventory, accounts receivable or cash.
        </p>
        <p>Current assets should be listed in order of increasing <b>liquidity</b>.</p>
        <p>Liquidity means how easy it is for an item to be turned into cash.</p>
        <p>As a result, inventory should be listed <i>first</i> because it is the hardest to turn into cash. 
            It is the hardest because it needs to be sold to customers, and if customers don't want to 
            buy it then there's nothing you can do to get the cash.
        </p>
        <p>Next in the list would be accounts receivable. This is money that customers owe the business 
            for sales made on credit. This is easier to turn into cash as most customers who buy 
            products on credit intend to pay back the business usually by the end of the month.
        </p>
        <p>Last on the list would be cash. This is the actual cash the business has. It may be paper money 
            or money in the bank or in mobile money services such as airtel money and tnm mpamba.
        </p>
        <p>Non-current assets can be listed according to any order.</p>
