        <h1>7.7 Accruals</h1>
        <p>An <b>accrual</b> happens where the benefit of an expense has been received but the expense 
            has not been paid for during the fiscal period that just ended.</p>
        <p>Since the accrual will need to be paid for in the <i>next</i> fiscal period, an accrual 
            is a <u>current liability</u>.</p>    
        <p>For example, Thomas uses electricity throughout the month of December 2020 and only expects 
            to receive the bill in January 2021 which is part of the next fiscal period. </p>
        <p>Since we are preparing financial statements for the fiscal period that just ended, we need to 
            show that the cost of the expense is to be paid for in the current fiscal period.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, in order to adjust the financial statements for an accrual:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Add</i> the accrual amount to the expense on the statement of profit or loss.</li>
                <li><i>Add</i> the accrual amount as a current liability on the statement of financial position.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
