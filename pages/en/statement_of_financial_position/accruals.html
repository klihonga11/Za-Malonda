        <h1>7.7 Accruals</h1>
        <p>An <b>accrual</b> happens where the benefit of an expense has been received but the expense 
            has not been paid for during the current fiscal period.</p>
        <p>Since the accrual will need to be paid for in the <i>next</i> fiscal period, an accrual 
            is a <u>current liability</u>.</p>    
        <p>For example, Thomas uses electricity throughout the month of December 2020 but only expects 
            to receive the bill in January 2021. This means he will have to pay for this expense in the 
            next fiscal period but that payment will be for a benefit received in the current fiscal period. </p>
        <p>Since we are preparing financial statements for the <i>current</i> fiscal period, we need to 
            show that the cost of the expense is going to be paid for in the next fiscal period.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, in order to adjust the financial statements for an accrual:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Add</i> the accrual amount to the expense on the statement of profit or loss.</li>
                <li><i>Add</i> the accrual amount as a current liability on the statement of financial position.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
