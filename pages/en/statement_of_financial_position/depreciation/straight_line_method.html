        <h1>7.4.2 Straight Line Method</h1>

        <p>The <b>straight line method</b> aims to spread the cost of a non-current asset by 
            <u>the same amount</u> over its useful life.
        </p>
        <p>This is the simplest and most common method of calculating depreciation.</p>
        <p><mark>Depreciation Charge = (Cost - Residual Value) / useful life</mark></p>
        <p><b>Depreciation charge</b> is the amount added to the statement of profit or loss to spread the cost 
            of non-current assets over the life of those assets.</p>
        <p><b>Residual value</b> is the amount a non-current asset is worth at the end of its useful life. </p>
        
        <br />
        <p>The statement of financial position records non-current assets as having a cost, accumulated 
            depreciation and net book value.</p>
        <p><b>Accumulated depreciation</b> (Accum. Depn.) is the total depreciation that has been charged 
            on an asset since it was bought.</p>
        <p><b>Net book value</b> (NBV) is calculated by taking the cost of a non-current asset and <u>subtracting</u> the 
            accumulated depreciation that has been charged on that asset since it was bought.
        </p>
        <p><mark>Net Book Value (NBV) = Cost - Accumulated Depreciation</mark></p>

        <br />
        <p>Thomas expects to use the bucket he bought at K 1,000 for two years, after which 
            he will throw it away and buy a new bucket. Therefore, the cost is K 1,000, the residual value 
            is K 0 and the useful life is two years. Using the formula above, the depreciation charge at 
            the end of the first fiscal period will be K 500.
        </p>
        <p>We will now include the K 500 in a new 'depreciation' account (an expense) and it will be 
            debited as it is an increase. Since we are using <u>double</u> entry bookkeeping, we will also 
            include the K 500 in the 'bucket' account (an asset) and it will be credited as it is a decrease.
        </p>
        <p>The trial balace will need to updated with a depreciation account balance of K 500 and the 
            bucket account balance will reduce by K 500.
        </p>
        <p>In the statement of profit or loss, the depreciation charge of K 500 will now be included as 
            an expense. This will reduce the net profit to K 5,500.
        </p>
        <p>Lastly, in the statement of financial position, the K 500 would be the accumulated depreciation 
            for the bucket. This would be subtracted from the cost of K 1000 to give a NBV of K 500. The net
            profit balance under Equity will also be updated to K 5,500. 
        </p>
        <p>For the next fiscal period, the process will be the same with the accumulated depreciation 
            rising to K 1000, for a net book value of K 0 after which Thomas will throw away the bucket 
            as planned.
