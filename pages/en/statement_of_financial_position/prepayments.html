        <h1>7.6 Prepayments</h1>
        <p>A <b>prepayment</b> happens where an expense has been paid for but the benefit will only be 
            received in the <i>next</i> fiscal period. 
        </p>
        <p>Since the prepayment will make the business money in the next fiscal period, a prepayment 
            is a <u>current asset</u>.</p>
        <p>For example, Thomas pays the rent for his shop for December, January, and February. Since the 
            current fiscal period ends in December, the <i>total</i> amount paid for the next fiscal period 
            - January and February, will be a prepayment.</p>
        <p>Since we are preparing financial statements for the current fiscal period, we need to 
            make changes to show that part or all of the benefit of the expense will only be received in 
            the next fiscal period.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, in order to adjust the financial statements for a prepayment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Subtract</i> the prepaid amount from the expense on the statement of profit or loss.</li>
                <li><i>Add</i> the prepaid amount as a current asset on the statement of financial position. 
                The prepayment should be listed before cash.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
