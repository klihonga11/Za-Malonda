        <h1>7.7 Prepayments</h1>
        <p>A <b>prepayment</b> happens where an expense has been paid for but the benefit will only be 
            received in the <i>next</i> fiscal period. 
        </p>
        <p>Since the prepayment will make the business money in the next fiscal period, a prepayment 
            is a <u>current asset</u>.</p>
        <p>For example, if Thomas pays the rent for his shop three months in advance going into the next 
            fiscal period.</p>
        <p>Since we are preparing financial statements for the fiscal period that just ended, we need to 
            make changes to show that the benefit of the expense will only be received in the next fiscal 
            period.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, in order to adjust the financial statements for a prepayment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Subtract</i> the prepaid amount from the expense on the statement of profit or loss.</li>
                <li><i>Add</i> the prepaid amount as a current asset on the statement of financial position. 
                The prepayment should be listed before cash.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
