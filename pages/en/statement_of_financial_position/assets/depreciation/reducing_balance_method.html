        <h1>7.3.4.3 Reducing Balance Method</h1>

        <p>Using the <b>reducing balance method</b>, the depreciation charge is highest in the <i>first</i> 
            year and then reduces every year after that.
        </p>
        <p>This is done by calculating the depreciation percentage on the NBV of the asset.</p>
        <p><mark>Depreciation Charge = Net Book Value * Depreciation Percentage</mark></p>
        <p>Use this method of depreciation if the non-current asset is going to be used more at the 
            beginning of it's useful life than towards the end.
        </p>
        
        <br />
        <p>For example, Thomas wants to depreciate the bicycle he bought for K 15,000 at a rate of 20% 
            per annum (every year) using the reducing balance method.
        </p>
        <p>Using the formula, the first year's depreciation charge will be K 3,000. In the first year, the 
            cost equals the NBV since the asset has never been depreciated.
        </p>
        <p>The adjustments to the accounts, trial balance and financial statements will be exactly the 
            same as the straight line method.</p>
        <p>For the second year, the depreciation charge will be K 2,400 because the percentage is 
            calculated on the NBV.
        </p>
        <p>Similarly, in the third year, the depreciation charge will be K 1,920.</p>
        <p>Businesses need to decide which depreciation method to use for each type of non-current asset.
        Once decided, businesses need to apply this policy consistently for all similar assets.</p>
