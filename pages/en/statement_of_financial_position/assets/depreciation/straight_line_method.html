            <h1>7.3.4.2 Straight Line Method</h1>

            <p>The <b>straight line method</b> aims to spread the cost of a non-current asset by 
                <i>the same amount</i> over its useful life.
            </p>
            <p>This is the simplest and most common method of calculating depreciation.</p>
            <p>The <b>depreciation charge</b> is how much a non-current asset will reduce in 
                value <i>per</i> fiscal period throughout its useful life.
            </p>
            <p><mark>Depreciation Charge = (Cost - Residual Value) / Useful Life</mark></p>
            <p><b>Cost</b> is the amount of money the non-current asset was bought for.</p>
            <p><b>Residual value</b> is the amount a non-current asset is worth at the end of its useful life. </p>
            <p><b>Useful life</b> is how long a non-current asset will be used for. </p>
            <p>The depreciation charge is added to the statement of profit or loss as an expense.</p>
            
            <br />
            <p>The statement of financial position records non-current assets as having a cost, accumulated 
                depreciation, and net book value.</p>
            <p><b>Accumulated depreciation</b> (Accum. Depn.) is the total depreciation that has been charged 
                on an asset since it was bought.</p>
            <p><b>Net book value</b> (NBV) is calculated by taking the cost of a non-current asset and <i>subtracting</i> the 
                accumulated depreciation that has been charged on that asset since it was bought.
            </p>
            <p><mark>Net Book Value (NBV) = Cost - Accumulated Depreciation</mark></p>

            <br />
            <p>For example, Thomas expects to use the bucket he bought at K 1,000 for two years, after which 
                he will sell it for K200. Therefore, the cost is K 1,000, the residual value 
                is K 200 and the useful life is two years. Using the formula above, the depreciation charge at 
                the end of the first fiscal period will be K 400.
            </p>
            <p>Since this depreciation charge is an expense, we will need to record the transaction and 
                update the accounts.
            </p>
            <p>We will now include the K 400 in a new 'depreciation' account (an expense) and it will be 
                debited as it is an increase. Since we are using <i>double</i> entry bookkeeping, we will also 
                include the K 400 in the 'bucket' account (an asset) and it will be credited as it is a decrease.
            </p>
            <p>The trial balance will need to be updated with a depreciation account balance of K 400 and the 
                bucket account balance will reduce by K 400.
            </p>
            <p>In the statement of profit or loss, the depreciation charge of K 400 will now be included as 
                an expense. This will reduce the net profit to K 5,600.
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, in the statement of financial position, the K 400 would be the accumulated depreciation 
                for the bucket. This would be subtracted from the cost of K 1000 to give an NBV of K 600. The net
                profit balance under Equity will also be updated to K 5,600. 
            </p>
            <p>For the next fiscal period, the process will be the same with the accumulated depreciation 
                rising to K 800, for a net book value of K 200 after which Thomas will sell the bucket 
                as planned.
