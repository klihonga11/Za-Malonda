        <p>The second part of the statement of profit or loss is for calculating the <b>net profit</b>.</p>
        <p>Net profit is the profit a business makes after removing the cost of the products it sold 
            <u>and</u> any costs it takes to run the business on a day-to-day basis.
        </p>
        <p>It is calculated as the gross profit minus expenses.</p>
        <p><mark>Net profit = gross profit - expenses</mark></p>

        <br />
        <p>Thomas spends K 500 for transport which is an expense to his business. His gross 
            profit is K 2,500, therefore his net profit on 31 January 2020 is K 2,000.
        </p>

        <p>When talking about whether a business is profitable, it refers to the net profit 
            and <u>not</u> the gross profit.
        </p>

        <p>If a business makes a <b>loss</b>, this means that the business has more costs than it does sales.</p> 
        <p>When a loss happens, the net profit will be <u>negative</u>.</p>
