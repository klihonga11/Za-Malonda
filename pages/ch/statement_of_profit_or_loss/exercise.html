            <p></p>The image above shows Thomas's trial balance at the end of the year.
            <p>After running his business for six months, Thomas was able to get a loan of K 50,000 from friends 
            and family to continue growing his business.</p>
            <p>As a result, he was able to buy a bicycle for K 15,000 to be used instead of paying money for 
                transport.</p>
            <p>He took K 5,000 out of the business to pay for his sonâ€™s school fees. </p>
            <p>With the loan, he was able to buy more goods for resale and needed a place to sell them. </p>
            <p>As a result, he rented a store and hired an employee to help him. </p>
            <p>He has also starting buying and selling products on credit. Products bought on credit are 
                belong to the <b>Accounts Payable</b> account, while sales made on credit belong to the 
                <b>Accounts Receivable</b> account.
            </p>
            <p>Later in the year, his bicycle broke down and he needed to pay for repairs.</p>
            <p>Inventory left unsold at the end of the year amounted to K 20,000.</p>

            <br />
            <p>Using the trial balance as at 31 December 2020, prepare Thomas's statement of profit or loss.</p>
