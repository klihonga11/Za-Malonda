            <p>The first part of the statement of profit or loss is for calculating the <b>gross profit</b>.</p>
            <p>Gross profit is the profit a business makes after <i>only</i> removing the cost of the products it sold. </p>
            <p><mark>Gross profit = sales - cost of sales</mark></p>

            <p><b>Cost of sales</b> (also known as cost of goods sold) is the cost of the products that were sold during the fiscal period.</p>
            <p>The cost of sales is calculated by taking the cost of any products available at the start of 
                the fiscal period (Opening Inventory), <i>adding</i> the purchases made during the fiscal period and 
                <i>subtracting</i> the cost of any products that have not been sold by the end of the fiscal period (Closing Inventory).
            </p>
            <p><mark>Cost of sales = opening inventory + purchases - closing inventory</mark></p>
            <p><b>Inventory</b> is just another word for products that the business buys to sell to its customers.</p>

            <br />
            <p>When Thomas starts his business, he has no opening inventory. He then purchases 
                inventory amounting to K 2,500. By the end of January, he has sold all his inventory and so 
                he has no closing inventory. Therefore, his cost of sales on 31 January 2020 is K 2,500.
            </p>
            <p>Thomas's sales for the month of January are K 3,750.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Thomas's gross profit is K 1,250.</p>
