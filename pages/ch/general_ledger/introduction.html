        <h1>4.1 Introduction</h1>
        <p>This is the second step of the double entry bookkeeping process.</p>
        <p>After entering the transaction in the general journal, the same transaction must be entered in 
            the <b>general ledger</b>.</p>
        <p>While a general journal records transactions according to the date, a general ledger shows the 
            same transactions but according to the <u>accounts</u> they belong to.</p>
        <p>The process of copying information from the journal to the ledger is called <b>posting</b>.</p>
        <p>Similar to the special journals, you can also have different ledgers to record information about 
            different types of accounts that have a high number of transactions. They are called <b>subsidiary ledgers.</b></p>
        <p>Some common subsidiary ledgers are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Accounts Receivable Ledger</b> - includes accounts of customers who owe the 
                    business money for products bought on credit.</li>
                <li><b>Accounts Payable Ledger</b> - includes accounts of suppliers who the business 
                    owes money for products purchased on credit.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <br />
        <p><em>Note</em>: For purposes of this course, we will <u>only</u> record entries in the general ledger.</p>
