            <h1>2.3.4 Example</h1>
            <p>When Thomas pays the money for transport, the ‘transport’ account (an expense) is increased 
                because the amount of money used for transport has increased, and so it is debited with K 500. 
            </p>
            <p> Because this is <i>double</i> entry bookkeeping, the ‘cash’ account (an asset) is also decreased because 
                money went out of the business to pay for transport and so it is credited with the same amount of K 500.</p>
            <p>A major benefit of this method is that it is easy to find errors because the total debits and 
                total credits will <i>always</i> be the same. This is the automatic error checking. 
            <p>If the total debits and total credits are not the same, then there is an error and you can 
                check your accounts to find it before continuing. This is known as <u>balancing 
                the books</u>.
            </p>
            <p>When presenting your transactions for external use such as applying for a loan, you will 
                be expected to have recorded your transactions using double entry bookkeeping. So it does not matter how small 
                your business may be, you should use this method from the start if you plan on growing your business.
            </p>
            <p>Since Thomas wants to grow his business, you will be helping him using this method.
