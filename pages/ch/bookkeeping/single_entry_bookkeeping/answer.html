        <p><b>Purchases:</b> the amount of money a business spends on buying products that it will sell to 
            its customers. Thomas bought sugarcane to sell to his customers and so these are purchases. 
            Thomas also spent money on transport, but he is not going to sell this transport to his 
            customers so it is <i>not</i> part of purchases.
        </p>
        <p><b>Sales:</b> the amount of money you receive from selling products to your customers.</p>
