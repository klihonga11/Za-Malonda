        <h1>2.2.1 Introduction</h1>
        <p><b>Single entry bookkeeping</b> is good for businesses that are very small and deal with a small number of 
            <i>cash</i> transactions every month.
        </p>
        <p>When recording the transaction, only one entry is recorded as either positive (money coming into 
            the business) or negative (money going out of the business).
        </p>
        <p>An example of a positive transaction would be receiving money from selling a product while a 
            negative transaction would be losing money when paying the rent.
        </p>
        <p>As a result, single entry bookkeeping can be used to calculate <b>net income</b> at the end of a period.
        </p>
        <p>Net income is the total money that came into the business minus the total money that went out of 
            the business over a period of time.
