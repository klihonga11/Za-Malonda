        <p>A <b>liability</b> is an amount of money the business owes that needs to be paid. For example, 
            Thomas needs to pay back the K 50,000 loan.</p>
        <p>Non-current liabilities refers to money that the business owes that will continue to be paid for 
            <i>after</i> the current fiscal period. For example, long term loans.</p>
        <p>Current liabilities refers to money the business owes to be paid  for <i>within</i> the current fiscal period. 
            For example, money owed to suppliers for purchases made on credit.</p>

        <p>Both non-current and current liabilities can be listed in any order.</p>
