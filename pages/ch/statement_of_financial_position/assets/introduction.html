        <p> An <b>asset</b> an item the business owns that will help make the business money in future.</p>

        <p>For example, buying a car that will be used to make deliveries for a business is an asset. </p>

        <p>However, buying furniture to make an office look nice would be an <i>expense</i> because that 
            furniture will <i>not</i> make the business money in the future.</p>
