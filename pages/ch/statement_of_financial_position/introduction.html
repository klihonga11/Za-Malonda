        <h1>7.1 Introduction</h1>

        <p>The <b>statement of financial position</b> is a financial statement that shows the assets and 
            liabilities of a business on a specific date and how the business has been financed.</p>
        <p>This statement is prepared to understand the financial health of the business. </p>
        <p>For example, it can tell a business owner whether the business owes more money to suppliers than 
            what it actually has in the bank.</p>
        <p>The numbers used in a statement of financial position are taken from the trial balance.</p>
        <p>In the statement of financial position, the total of the assets must <i>always</i> be equal 
            to the total of the liabilities plus the equity. This is called the <u>accounting equation</u>.</p>
        <p><mark>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</mark></p>
