        <p><em>Note</em>: The account balance is the balance carried forward for that account on the 
            date the trial balance is prepared. However, you'll note that the balance carried forward will be on 
            the opposite side of the account in the general ledger. For example, the balance carried forward for the cash 
            account is on the credit side and yet it is listed as a debit balance on the trial balance. 
            In the general ledger, this is just for calculation purposes to make sure the total debits and total credits 
            stay the same. As the balance is brought forward to the next month, it is placed on the debit side and so it 
            will be a debit balance on the trial balance.
