        <h1>5.1 Introduction</h1>
        <p>A <b>trial balance</b> is a list of all the account balances (from the general ledger) at a 
            specific point in time.</p>
        <p>This point in time is usually at the end of a business’s <b>fiscal period</b>.</p>
        <p>A fiscal period is a period of time the business operates at the end of which, the business’s 
            accounts are closed.</p>
        <p>A fiscal period is usually a year (twelve months) but it can also be a quarter (four months).</p>
        <p>A trial balance lists <u>all</u> the account balances, showing whether there is a debit or a credit balance on each account.</p>
        <p>The trial balance should always balance – the total of the debit balances should equal the total of the credit balances.</p>
        <p>If it does not balance, it means there is a mistake in your general ledger or journal and you 
            need to correct it before preparing any financial statements.</p>
