        <h1>3.1 Introduction</h1>
        <p>This is the <i>first</i> step of the double entry bookkeeping process.</p>
        <p>This is a book where <i>all</i> financial transactions are first recorded.</p>
        <p>The transactions are recorded according to the date from the earliest to the latest date.</p>
        <p>The process of entering transactions into a journal is known as <b>journalizing</b>.</p>
        <p>A journal is also known as a <u>daybook</u>.</p>
        <p>For a small business, simply having a general journal is enough. But as the number of 
            transactions increases, a business may want to have <b>special journals</b> to record 
            different transactions such as:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Sales Journal</b> – used to record <i>credit</i> sales.</li>
                <li><b>Purchases Journal</b> – used to record <i>credit</i> purchases.</li>
                <li><b>Cash Receipts Journal</b> – used to record any transaction where money comes into the business including <i>cash</i> sales.</li>
                <li><b>Cash Payments Journal</b> – used to record any transaction money goes out of the business including <i>cash</i> purchases.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Any other transactions that cannot be entered in these four special journals will be entered in the general journal. For example, if someone returns goods that are expired or not working.</p>

        <br />
        <p><em>Note</em>: For purposes of this course, we will <i>only</i> record entries in the general journal.</p>
